% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled. 
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%   
%   * Removed outdated text.

\begin{abstract}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have seen a rise in \textit{mixed} (MR) and \textit{augmented reality} (AR) applications and devices in recent years. Subsequently, we have become familiar with the sensing power of these applications and devices, and we are only starting to realize the nascent risks that these technology puts over our privacy and security. Current privacy protection measures are primarily aimed towards known and well-utilised data types (i.e. location, on-line activity, biometric, and so on) while a few works have focused on looking into the security and privacy risks of and providing protection on MR data, particularly on 3D MR data. In this paper, we reveal the privacy leakage from raw 3D MR data and how they persist even after implementing spatial generalizations and abstractions. %; \textcolor{red}{thus, these approaches, especially RANSAC or similar plane generalizations, cannot be used for privacy protection.}
Firstly, we formalize the \textit{spatial} privacy problem in 3D mixed reality data as well as the adversary model. Then, we demonstrate through an inference model how adversaries can identify and potentially reconstruct 3D spaces. Moreover, we also demonstrate how compact these 3D representations can be in terms of memory usage which allows adversaries to create lightweight 3D inference models for user spaces.
